# Python-Password-Manager
 
This project is a Python-based password manager created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of secure application development. Designed with a focus on learning and implementing best practices in encryption, database management, and data security, this project provided hands-on experience in essential backend technologies.

The password manager uses SQLite to store credentials securely and the cryptography library to encrypt passwords, safeguarding sensitive information. I chose to build this application using Pythonâ€™s standard libraries to enhance my familiarity with data storage, encryption mechanisms, and key management principles. For security, the application generates a unique encryption key stored locally, which encrypts passwords before they are saved to the database and decrypts them only on demand.

Through this project, I developed skills in secure coding practices, data handling, and practical encryption. This experience has strengthened my foundation for further exploration into cybersecurity and secure software development, aligning with my career aspirations in tech.
